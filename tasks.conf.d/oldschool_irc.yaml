  Yo, I heard you like old-school stuff. In ancient times, there were IRC networks. They were full of great people and helpful bots.

  Check out this IRC server and talk to the OP in `#challenge` (enable TLS in your IRC client!).

  Since the OP is a bot, he is not very talkative. Surely you'll figure out how to communicate with him!

  P.S. For a true 0ldsch00l experience, use an command line IRC client like `irssi` :)
