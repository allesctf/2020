  Our investigation team found a strange device in a network.
  They got a firmware dump right before they were detected, and in the last second, they managed to send it out to us.

  We need to know more and have to exploit the remote service, but we can't bypass the login.
  
  Please be gentle with the ESPs, they are real devices and won't survive that much traffic. No scanning, no dirbusting and no bruteforce!
